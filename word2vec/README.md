# Word2Vec

This is a simplified version of word2vec to produce word embeddings with linear relationships.

In this simplified implementation, we initialize 2 random |V| x D matrices where V is the set of vocabulary words and D is an arbitrary dimensionality hyperparameter. One matrix represents the "outside word" embeddings and the other matrix represents the "center word" embeddings.
