Ben: American men are naturally taller than Chinese men. So even if I exercise, there aren't many chances.
Jackson: No, that's not true. I'Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese. But those Chinese look very strong and healthy. So if you exercise more often, I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls. How old is Jacky Chan? He's small and short. But I bet he can have any American woman he wants.

Jackson: That's helpful. Thanks. But what do you think about philosophy. I wanted to take that class this semester.
Ben: I took that class last year. The professor is really cool, so if you go to his office, you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full.

Ben: By the middle of October, I think.

Ben: I understand.
Jackson: Besides, the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks.

Ben: But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter. In fact, many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter.

Ben: So do we. Certainly it's a step forward on your side. But the gap is still too wide.
Jackson: The ball is in your court, Mrs.Wang. What price would you suggest?

Jackson: That won't do. You see, our profit margin is very narrow. It simply can't stand such a big cut.

Ben: For my part, xiangqi. Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese.
Jackson: I think chess is more reasonable. You see, each side has eight pawns, a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi. A true battle should be like that. Soldiers should outnumber the commanders.
Ben: Quite right. And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi, the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank. It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance.
Jackson: Correct! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king. It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent. They are required to stay in the palace, waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards. Look at the king in chess, he is much more capable.
Ben: Yeah, and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards, he has a queen who is the most powerful piece. I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China.
Jackson: There's another distinctive contrast. Both board games use a total of 32 pieces, but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board, bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess.
Ben: You mean, xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around?
Jackson: Sure. On a chessboard, fire is much more intensive. It has a smaller board, while those bigger pieces-chariots, horses and bishops-can cover longer distances.","Jackson and Ben discuss the differences between chess and xiangqi.

Ben: It's true with me. Others may succeed in fixing.
Jackson: Yet most people believe a hard marriage is better for children than a divorce. According to a recent poll, more people today think parents should stay together for the sake of the children What do you think?
Ben: I think the cost of staying together is worse than the benefits. Parents quarreling and fighting all day may do more harm to their children.

dev_466,"Jackson: Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space?
Ben: No, the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them. But not too much. As the space between galaxies expands, it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough.
Jackson: But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy. If galaxies are moving apart from each other, how can they collide?
Ben: Well, the universe is a chaotic place, and the gravity from one galaxy, or from a group of galaxies, may disturb the motion of its near neighbors, causing them to collide. However, on average, when you compare two large enough chunks of space, the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other.

We saw workers in supermarket being added on. Part of that reflects the settlement of the grocery stores strike out California. We saw workers in the health care sector and hospitals being added on. We saw business services adding employees.
